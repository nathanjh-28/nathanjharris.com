#### Welcome
Iâ€™m a software developer and current computer science student with a unique background in lighting console programming for major film productions. After a successful career working with academy award winning talent, I transitioned into software development to apply my problem-solving and communication skills to new challenges. I specialize in building tools that simplify complex processes and help people focus on what matters most.
